# Combo Boxes

> A combo box combines a text field with a pull-down button, letting people enter a custom value or choose from a list of predefined values.

**Platforms:** macOS only

Custom values are not added to the predefined list. See also text-fields and pull-down-buttons.

## Best Practices

- **Meaningful default value from the list** — even if not the first item; empty default misses the opportunity to convey what the list contains.
- **Introductory label** — title-style capitalization, ends with a colon. Tells people what type of items to expect.
- **Provide relevant predefined choices** — the list should cover common values while still allowing custom entry.
- **List items no wider than the text field** — truncation in the dropdown is hard to read.

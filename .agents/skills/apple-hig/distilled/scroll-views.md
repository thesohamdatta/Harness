# Scroll Views

> A scroll view lets people view content larger than the view's boundaries by moving it vertically or horizontally.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

No visual appearance of its own. A scroll view can display indicators whose behavior varies by platform; tvOS has no distinct scroll indicators. Indicators show the relative position of visible content (beginning / middle / end).

## Best Practices

- **Support default scrolling gestures and keyboard shortcuts** - people expect consistent system behavior; custom scrolling must use the same elastic behavior.
- **Make scrollability apparent** - scroll indicators aren't always visible. Show partial content at the edge to signal more is available.
- **No nested scroll views with the same orientation** - creates unpredictable, hard-to-control interfaces. Orthogonal nesting is fine (horizontal inside vertical or vice versa).
- **Page-by-page scrolling** - define a page size (usually current view height/width) and an overlap unit (a line of text, a row of glyphs) to maintain context across page boundaries.
- **Automatic scrolling: only as much as necessary:**
  - App selects content/places insertion point outside the current view -> scroll to bring it in.
  - Insertion point is on another page when typing begins -> scroll back.
  - Pointer moves past view edge during selection -> follow the pointer.
  - People scroll away while content is selected -> scroll selection back into view before acting.
- **Zoom: set appropriate min/max scale values** - zooming until one character fills the screen rarely makes sense.

## Scroll Edge Effects (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)

A _scroll edge effect_ visually separates floating interface elements (like toolbars) from scrolling content behind them. System applies it automatically in most cases; add manually for custom bars or layouts.

| Style       | Use                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automatic   | Prefer by default. Adapts to top toolbars with many controls, text outside Liquid Glass controls, and pinned table headers |
| Soft / Hard | Override only after testing. Soft can reduce legibility; hard gives a more opaque, defined boundary                        |

- **Only use scroll edge effects adjacent to floating interface elements** - not decorative. They exist where controls and content meet.
- **One scroll edge effect per view** - in split views, each pane can have its own but keep heights consistent.

## Platform Considerations

### iOS, iPadOS

- **Show a page control for page-by-page mode** - don't show both the page control and the scroll indicator on the same axis.

### macOS

- Scroll indicator is called a _scroll bar_.
- **Small or mini scroll bars in tight panels** - use consistent size for all controls in the panel.

### tvOS

- Not treated as distinct objects with indicators. System automatically scrolls to keep focused items visible.

### visionOS

- **Fixed-size indicator, always predictable position** - vertical: centered at trailing edge; horizontal: centered at bottom edge.
- Looking at the indicator and starting a drag reveals a **jog bar** with tick marks - people adjust scrolling speed rather than content position.
- **Account for indicator size in tight margins** - slightly thicker than iOS; may overlap content with very tight margins.
- **Support Look to Scroll for reading/browsing views** - not enabled by default; add it per scroll view.
- **Avoid Look to Scroll for secondary controls or dense precision areas** - keep gesture scrolling there.
- **Use clear scroll areas and consistent support** - full-width/height areas work best; remove custom scroll-position animations before enabling.

### watchOS

- **Prefer vertical scrolling** - Digital Crown naturally navigates vertically.
- **Use tab views for page-by-page scrolling** - tab views become pages in watchOS. Stack vertically; Digital Crown scrolls between them. System shows a page indicator next to the Digital Crown.
- **Limit individual page height to one screen** - clearest/most glanceable design. Variable-height pages okay but use judiciously, placed after fixed-height pages.

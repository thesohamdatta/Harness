| Slug                  | Result | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `virtual-keyboards`   | Pass   | Current file preserves prior keyboard-extension/custom-input guidance and adds source-backed watchOS availability plus API triggers.                                                    |
| `live-photos`         | Pass   | Current file preserves edit/intact/share/download/badge rules, adds source-backed visionOS view-only note and LivePhotosKit JS trigger.                                                 |
| `segmented-controls`  | Pass   | Current file correctly updates prior stricter "text or images, not both" wording to current-source "prefer either text or images, not a mix"; adds visionOS and momentary API triggers. |
| `text-fields`         | Pass   | Current related routing aligns with current source links: text views, combo boxes, virtual keyboards, and entering data. No old source-backed guidance lost.                            |
| `id-verifier`         | Pass   | Current file corrects platform scope to iOS, removes unsupported `MRZ`, adds current ProximityReader APIs, and preserves age/data-minimization and button-label guidance.               |
| `designing-for-macos` | Pass   | Only continuity-relevant change is removing the old Sidecar-specific wording; current source says additional displays including iPad.                                                   |
| `disclosure-controls` | Pass   | Current file preserves triangle/button behavior and adds source-backed visionOS, AppKit API names, and buttons related routing.                                                         |
| `action-sheets`       | Pass   | Current file preserves old action-sheet rules and adds source-backed watchOS support and current SwiftUI/UIKit APIs while removing stale `UIActionSheet`.                               |
| `app-icons`           | Pass   | Current file preserves icon sizes, safe zones, alternate-icon, text/photo/hardware prohibitions, and updates Icon Composer/Liquid Glass guidance from current source.                   |
| `boxes`               | Pass   | Current file preserves box title, nested-box, padding, and platform behavior; adds source-backed visionOS support.                                                                      |

## Incidence

This 10-entry sample found `0/10` new continuity regressions.

Combined with the prior 5-entry continuity sample, continuity-specific findings are `1/15` sampled files after one `wallet` remediation. The observed rate is therefore about 6.7%, but the sample is still too small to treat continuity risk as zero.

## Outcome

No changes required from this 10-entry sample.

# Boxes

> A box creates a visually distinct group of logically related information and components, using a visible border or background color.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS _(not tvOS, watchOS)_

Optional title. iOS/iPadOS use secondary and tertiary background colors. macOS displays the title above the box by default.

## Best Practices

- **Keep boxes relatively small** relative to the containing view — as a box approaches window/screen size, it loses its grouping function and crowds other content.
- **Use padding and alignment for sub-grouping within a box** — avoid nested boxes; they feel busy and constrained. The border itself is a strong visual element.
- **Title (if needed): succinct phrase describing contents** — sentence-style capitalization. No trailing punctuation — except in settings panes, where append a colon. A title also helps VoiceOver users predict content before entering the box.

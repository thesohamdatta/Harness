# Full Fidelity Audit Results

Source corpus: `sources/apple-hig-2026-06-09`

Audit scope: all 156 distilled files, organized by `full-audit-manifest.md`.

Method: read-only subagents compared each rendered source page with its distilled file. Main-agent integration checked current local rendered source before patching, then updated distilled files, metadata, routing, and disposition artifacts.

## Defect Rate

All 156 files received second-pass source-fidelity coverage. The audit produced source-backed or routing-backed changes in 117 files, a 75% file-level revision rate. This is high, but the distribution matters:

- Most findings were P2/P3 fidelity, trigger, related-routing, platform-scope, or spec-table compression issues.
- The highest-risk class was unsupported stale guidance that survived from the prior HIG version.
- The second-highest-risk class was over-compression of exact specifications, especially dimensions, API names, and platform-specific behavior.
- No `NEEDS-SOURCE-REVIEW` items remain after checking the local rendered source corpus.

## Remediation Summary

The integration pass remediated all `REVISE` findings by:

- Removing unsupported old guidance and broad triggers.
- Restoring exact measurements and platform distinctions where the source uses tables.
- Adding missing API/framework triggers where current source names them.
- Tightening related routing to current source links and strong in-page references.
- Moving broad design-principles routing into tier 1 so design judgment queries load it immediately.
- Updating `disposition-overrides.json`, `inventory.json`, `dispositions.md`, `routing-index.md`, and `README.md` after source-backed edits.

## Accepted Warning Classes

Remaining validator warnings are cross-file trigger overlaps. They are accepted as intentional routing overlaps when:

- A foundation file and a detailed topic share a concept.
- A platform overview and a component/pattern file share an Apple term.
- An API legitimately appears in adjacent topics.
- A feature family needs adjacent context, such as Siri/App Shortcuts/Snippets or HealthKit/Activity Rings.

There are no within-file duplicate trigger warnings.

## Result

Status: accepted after remediation.

No unremediated source-drift findings are deferred from the full-audit batches.

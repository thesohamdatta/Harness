# Menus

> A menu reveals its options when people interact with it - a space-efficient way to present commands in all experiences.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

Applies to all menu types: menu bar menus, context menus, pop-up/pull-down buttons, and in-game menus.

## Labels

- **Verb or verb phrase** for action items (View, Close, Select). Match your app's communication style.
- **Title-style capitalization** - capitalize every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and short prepositions; always capitalize the last word.
- **No articles** (a, an, the) - "View Settings" not "View the Settings".
- **Ellipsis (…)** - append when the action requires more input before completing.
- **Show unavailable items dimmed** - item responds to no interactions. Keep the menu itself accessible even if all items are unavailable.

## Icons

- Use **familiar icons** for common actions (Copy, Share, Delete) - same icons as the system, wherever they appear.
- **No icon if no clear match** - avoid ornamentation; don't add icons that might be confused with other actions.
- Apply uniform visual treatment within a group: give every item an icon, or give none of them icons.

## Organization

- **Important/frequent items first** - people scan from the top.
- **Group logically related items with a separator** (horizontal line or gap). Keep related items together even if some are rarely used.
- **Limit menu length** - long menus require more time/attention. Split into separate menus or use submenus. Exception: user-defined or dynamically generated content may be long.

## Submenus

- A submenu item shows a chevron after its label. Functionally identical to a regular menu with hierarchical positioning.
- **Use sparingly** - each level hides content and adds complexity. Appropriate when a term appears in more than two menu items in the same group.
- **Max one level deep** - multiple hierarchical levels are difficult to navigate.
- **Max ~5 items** per submenu - beyond that, create a new menu.
- **Submenu must stay available** even when all its nested items are unavailable.
- **Prefer submenus over indenting** - indented items don't clearly express hierarchy and are inconsistent with the platform.

## Toggled Items

- **Changeable label** - "Show Map" / "Hide Map" as a single item whose label changes with state.
- **Add a verb when the changeable label is ambiguous** - "Turn HDR On" / "Turn HDR Off" is clearer than "HDR On/Off."
- **Show both items simultaneously** when viewing both states at once helps.
- **Checkmark** - for a group of attributes, a checkmark on the active item makes it easy to scan which are applied.
- **"Plain" / remove-all item** - if people can apply multiple styles, consider an item that clears all at once.

## In-Game Menus

- **Use platform's default navigation** - touch on iOS, direct/indirect gestures on visionOS, etc.
- **Ensure menus remain readable and tappable** at all screen sizes. Scaling game content down can make menus too small.

## Platform Considerations

### iOS, iPadOS

Three menu layouts:

- **Small** - 4 unlabeled icon-only items in a top row, remaining items in list below.
- **Medium** - 3 items (icon + short label) in top row, remaining items in list below.
- **Large** (default) - all items in a list.

Use **medium** for 3 important frequently used actions. Use **small** only for closely related groups with recognizable symbols.

### visionOS

- Supports small and large layouts (same as iOS/iPadOS).
- Menus can extend beyond window boundaries (as on macOS).
- Use `presentationBreakthroughEffect(_:)`; effects include `BreakthroughEffect.automatic`, `.subtle`, `.prominent`, and `.none`.
- **Display menu near the content it controls** - people look at items before tapping; distant content means the effect is missed.
- **Prefer subtle breakthrough effect** - blends with surroundings and maintains depth/context. Use prominent only when critical; use none only in specific games where navigation around barriers is intentional.

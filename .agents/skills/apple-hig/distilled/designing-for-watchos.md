# Designing for watchOS

> Apple Watch delivers essential information and simple, timely task execution — glanceable, at a wrist raise.

**Platform:** watchOS

## Device Characteristics

|                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display**       | Small, high-resolution, wrist-worn; Always On display shows watch face on wrist drop                                                                                                                              |
| **Ergonomics**    | Worn on wrist; opposite hand interacts; viewing distance ≤1 ft on wrist raise                                                                                                                                     |
| **Inputs**        | Digital Crown (vertical scroll/data inspection), tap/swipe/drag gestures, Action button (essential action without looking), Siri shortcuts; GPS, blood oxygen, heart sensors, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope |
| **Usage pattern** | Many brief glances throughout the day; interactions often <1 min; complications, notifications, and Siri interactions used more than the app itself                                                               |

**Key system integrations:** Complications, notifications, Always On display, watch faces.

## Best Practices

- Design for **quick, glanceable, single-screen interactions** — deliver critical info succinctly and support actions with 1–2 gestures.
- Minimize navigation hierarchy depth. Use the Digital Crown for vertical navigation (scrolling, switching screens).
- Personalize proactively — use on-device data to surface relevant, actionable content in the moment.
- Use **complications** for relevant, potentially dynamic data directly on the watch face — tappable to deep-link into the app.
- Use **notifications** for timely, high-value information with actions people can take without opening the app.
- Use background color and materials to convey supporting info and establish hierarchy/sense of place.
- Design the app to function **independently**, complementing functionality from complications and notifications.

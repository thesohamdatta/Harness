# Final Smoke Tests

Source corpus: `sources/apple-hig-2026-06-09`

Smoke tests were checked against `SKILL.md` and regenerated `routing-index.md`.

| Query                                                | Expected loaded files                                                                      | Result |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| What principles should guide a new iOS app design?   | Tier 1 including `design-principles`; platform match `designing-for-ios`                   | Pass   |
| Review this interface using Apple design principles. | Tier 1 including `design-principles`, `accessibility`, `layout`, `privacy`, `writing`      | Pass   |
| What are the HIG rules for Liquid Glass color?       | Tier 1 `materials` and `color`; related `dark-mode` from materials/color context           | Pass   |
| How should token fields work?                        | Tier 4 direct match `token-fields`; related `search-fields` when expanded from the file    | Pass   |
| What are the privacy permission request guidelines?  | Tier 1 `privacy`; trigger match `onboarding` for permissions request                       | Pass   |
| What changed for sidebars/search fields/menus?       | Tier 3 matches `sidebars`, `search-fields`, and `menus`                                    | Pass   |
| How should Sign in with Apple be displayed?          | Tier 3 match `sign-in-with-apple`                                                          | Pass   |
| What are the rules for widgets in StandBy?           | Tier 3 match `widgets`; related platform/foundation files already available through tier 1 | Pass   |

Acceptance: broad design judgment routes through always-loaded `design-principles`; component/API queries route through generated trigger entries; tier-4 token fields load only on direct match.

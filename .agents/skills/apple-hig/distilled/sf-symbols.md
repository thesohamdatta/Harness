# SF Symbols

> Thousands of consistent, configurable symbols that integrate seamlessly with San Francisco system font, auto-aligning with text at all weights and sizes.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

Use symbols in toolbars, tab bars, context menus, and within text. Symbol availability varies by OS version — symbols introduced in a given year aren't available on earlier systems.

Don't use SF Symbols (or confusingly similar images) in app icons, logos, or any trademarked use.

## Rendering Modes

Symbols organize paths into primary, secondary, and tertiary **layers**. Four rendering modes:

| Mode             | Behavior                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Monochrome**   | One color applied to all layers. Paths render in specified color or transparent within color-filled paths.                                       |
| **Hierarchical** | One color, varying opacity per layer — creates visual depth.                                                                                     |
| **Palette**      | Two or more colors, one per layer. If only two colors specified for a three-layer symbol, secondary and tertiary share the second color.         |
| **Multicolor**   | Intrinsic colors for symbols where color carries meaning (e.g., `leaf` = green, `trash.slash` = red). Some layers can receive additional colors. |

Use system-provided colors in any rendering mode for automatic adaptation to accessibility and Dark Mode. Use the `automatic` setting to get a symbol's preferred mode; still verify legibility in all contexts. Developer APIs include `renderingMode(_:)`.

## Gradients (SF Symbols 7+)

Gradient rendering applies a smooth linear gradient from a single source color. Works at any size in all rendering modes, for system and custom colors, and custom symbols; it tends to look best at larger sizes.

## Variable Color

Represents a changing characteristic (capacity, signal strength) by applying color to layers as a value crosses defined thresholds between 0–100%.

- Use to communicate **change over time**, not to convey depth — use Hierarchical mode for depth.
- Layers can opt out of variable color (e.g., the speaker body in `speaker.wave.3` doesn't change with volume).
- Closed-loop symbols (circular paths, like a progress ring) feature seamless continuous variable color playback. Open-loop symbols (linear start/end points that don't meet) do not.

## Weights and Scales

- **9 weights** — ultralight to black — matching SF font weights for precise text/symbol weight pairing.
- **3 scales** — small, medium (default), large — defined relative to SF cap height. Adjusting scale changes symbol emphasis without disrupting weight matching.
- Developer APIs include `imageScale(_:)`, `UIImage.SymbolScale`, and `NSImage.SymbolConfiguration`.

## Design Variants

| Variant                              | Best used in                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Outline                              | Toolbars, lists, alongside text                                   |
| Fill                                 | Tab bars (iOS), swipe actions, selection states with accent color |
| Enclosed (circle, square, rectangle) | Improves legibility at small sizes                                |
| Slash                                | Unavailable state                                                 |

Outline + fill, enclosed + slash combinations are supported. Many views automatically choose outline vs. fill (e.g., iOS tab bars prefer fill; toolbars take outline) — no manual specification needed.

Language-specific variants (Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi, Thai, CJK, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Indic numerals) auto-apply when device language changes.

## Animations

Apply animations judiciously — too many overwhelm the interface. Each animation communicates a specific type of action; verify the meaning matches the intent. Symbol animations work on SF Symbols and custom symbols across rendering modes, weights, and scales; configure playback once or indefinitely, including speed, repeat, and reverse behavior. Developer APIs include `Symbols` and `SymbolEffect`.

| Animation                              | Behavior / Use                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Appear**                             | Symbol gradually emerges into view                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Disappear**                          | Symbol gradually recedes out of view                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Bounce**                             | Elastic scale movement returning to initial state. Communicates that an action occurred or needs to. Default: plays once.                                                                                                 |
| **Scale**                              | Persistent size change (doesn't return to original). Use for selection emphasis or tap feedback.                                                                                                                          |
| **Pulse**                              | Opacity variation over time. Pulses annotated layers (optionally all). Use for ongoing activity.                                                                                                                          |
| **Variable color**                     | Incrementally varies opacity of layers. Cumulative: changes persist per layer through cycle. Iterative: one layer at a time. Use for progress, connecting, broadcasting. Supports autoreverse and hiding inactive layers. |
| **Replace**                            | Swaps one symbol for another across weights/modes. Configs: Down-up (state change), Up-up (forward progression), Off-up (emphasize next state).                                                                           |
| **Magic Replace**                      | Default replace animation. Smart transition between related symbols (slashes draw on/off, badges appear/disappear); unrelated symbols fall back to down-up, with fallback direction customizable.                         |
| **Wiggle**                             | Back-and-forth on a directional axis. Use to highlight change, call to action, or directional meaning.                                                                                                                    |
| **Breathe**                            | Smooth opacity + size variation for a living quality. Use for status changes or ongoing activity (e.g., recording). Differs from Pulse: changes both opacity and size.                                                    |
| **Rotate**                             | Full or partial rotation. Use for in-progress indicators or real-world rotation behavior (e.g., fan blades via By Layer).                                                                                                 |
| **Draw On / Draw Off** (SF Symbols 7+) | Draws symbol along a path — all at once, staggered, or one layer at a time. Use for progress or to reinforce directionality.                                                                                              |

## Custom Symbols

Export a similar symbol's template → modify in a vector editor → annotate layers for rendering modes/color.

- Match system symbols in detail level, optical weight, alignment, position, and perspective.
- Custom symbols must be: simple, recognizable, inclusive, and directly related to the concept.
- Apple product/feature symbols may be displayed but not customized; the SF Symbols app marks them with an Info badge.
- Use **negative side margins** when a badge or element increases symbol width (naming pattern: e.g., `left-margin-Regular-M`).
- **Annotate layers** for variable color and animation support. Use whole shapes (not cutouts) for best animation behavior — use erase layers for negative space.
- Use the SF Symbols **component library** for common variants (enclosures, badges) — maintains design consistency.
- Provide **alternative text labels** for VoiceOver accessibility.
- Don't replicate Apple product designs.

# Web Views

> A web view loads and displays rich web content (HTML, websites) inline within your app.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS _(not tvOS, watchOS)_

## Best Practices

- **Support forward/back navigation when people will visit multiple pages.** This behavior isn't on by default — enable it explicitly and provide corresponding UI controls.
- **Don't build a web browser.** Brief, in-context web access is fine. Don't replicate Safari's functionality.

# NFC

> NFC (Near-Field Communication) lets iOS apps read data from electronic tags on real-world objects within a few centimeters.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS _(not macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS)_

## In-App Tag Reading

- Supports single- or multiple-object scanning while the app is active.
- **Don't encourage contact.** Proximity is enough — no touching required. Use _scan_ and _hold near_, not _tap_ and _touch_.
- **Use approachable terminology** — avoid technical terms in UI:

| ✅ Use                                                       | ❌ Don't use                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Scan the [object name]."                                    | "Scan the NFC tag."                                    |
| "Hold your iPhone near the [object] to learn more about it." | "To use NFC scanning, tap your phone to the [object]." |

- **Scanning sheet instructional text**: complete sentence, sentence case, ending punctuation. Identify the object. Update text for subsequent scans:

| First scan                                                        | Subsequent scan                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "Hold your iPhone near the [object name] to learn more about it." | "Now hold your iPhone near another [object name]." |

## Background Tag Reading

- Background reading scans when the screen is illuminated.
  Background tag reading notifies users when a tag is detected without opening your app — they tap the notification to pass data to your app.

**Not available when**: NFC scanning sheet is visible; Wallet/Apple Pay in use; camera in use; Airplane Mode; device locked after restart.

- **Always provide in-app scanning too** — not all devices support background reading.

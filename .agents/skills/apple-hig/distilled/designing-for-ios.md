# Designing for iOS

> iPhone helps people stay connected, play games, view media, accomplish tasks, and track personal data — anywhere, on the go.

**Platform:** iOS

## Device Characteristics

|                   |                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display**       | Medium-size, high-resolution                                                                              |
| **Ergonomics**    | One or both hands; portrait or landscape; viewing distance ≤1–2 ft                                        |
| **Inputs**        | Multi-Touch gestures, virtual keyboard, voice control; gyro/accelerometer; spatial interactions           |
| **Usage pattern** | Ranges from quick 1–2 min checks to 1+ hr sessions; multiple apps open simultaneously, frequent switching |

**Key system integrations:** widgets, home screen quick actions, Spotlight search, Shortcuts, activity views.

## Best Practices

- Limit onscreen controls — let secondary details and actions be discoverable with minimal interaction.
- Adapt seamlessly to orientation changes, Dark Mode, and Dynamic Type.
- Place controls where they're reachable with typical one-hand grip — middle and bottom of display preferred. Support swipe-to-go-back and swipe actions in list rows.
- With permission, use platform capabilities (payments, biometric authentication, location) instead of asking people to enter data manually.

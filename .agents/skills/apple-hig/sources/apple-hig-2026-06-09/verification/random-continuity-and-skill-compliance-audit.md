# Random Continuity and Skill Compliance Audit

Compared current `ios27` distills against `origin/main` prior distills.

Random seed: `20260610`

Sample universe: 150 distilled files present in both current branch and `origin/main`.

Sampled files:

- `file-management`
- `apple-pencil-and-scribble`
- `wallet`
- `gestures`
- `designing-for-games`

## Continuity Results

| Slug                        | Result             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `file-management`           | Pass               | Current file preserves prior core guidance and adds source-backed macOS/visionOS, `DocumentGroupLaunchScene`, File Provider, and Finder Sync coverage.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `apple-pencil-and-scribble` | Pass               | Current file preserves Pencil/Scribble behavior, corrects platform scope to iPadOS, removes unsupported `drag-and-drop` related routing, and adds source-backed PaperKit/App Shortcuts details.                                                                                                        |
| `wallet`                    | Fixed during audit | Random comparison found continuity/source regression: current file had dropped explicit expiration/relevant-date/voided pass properties, change-message restrictions, and field-role detail that existed in `origin/main` and remains in current Apple source. Restored compact source-backed bullets. |
| `gestures`                  | Pass               | Current file preserves prior standard/custom gesture guidance and adds source-backed visionOS system overlay and watchOS Double Tap API details.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `designing-for-games`       | Pass               | Current file preserves prior game design guidance; visionOS table now matches current source (`Touch`) while retaining a clarifying note about eyes/hands and indirect/direct gestures.                                                                                                                |

## Skill Compliance Results

| OpenAI hosted file count     | Pass for clean checkout/runtime package; caution for dirty workspace zip | Tracked clean checkout: 187 files; runtime-only package: 167 files. Current local working directory without `.git` has 542 files because ignored raw/rendered source captures are present; do not zip the whole workspace with ignored files included for hosted upload. |

| Routing index                | Pass                                                                     | `python scripts/generate_routing_index.py --check` reports current.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## Outcome

Continuity sanity check passes after the `wallet` remediation. Technical installability passes if the skill is packaged from a clean checkout or runtime-only folder named `apple-hig`.

# Apple Pay

> Apple Pay lets people pay for physical goods and services, donations, and subscriptions securely across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS.

> **Apple Pay vs. In-App Purchase**: Use Apple Pay for physical goods, services, donations. Use In-App Purchase for virtual goods and digital subscriptions.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS, watchOS _(not tvOS)_

## Offering Apple Pay

- Apple Pay works in apps and any browser. People can authorize with a nearby iPhone or Apple Watch, scan a code, or use device authentication including `Optic ID` where available.
- Web: use `applePayCapabilities`, semantic markup that search engines can index, a privacy statement, and Apple's acceptable-use requirements.
- **Offer on all supported devices.** Use Apple Pay APIs to detect support — don't show the option if the device can't use it.
- **If you use APIs to check for an active card, Apple Pay must be the primary payment option** everywhere you use those APIs.
- **Feature Apple Pay at least as prominently as other payment options** on every page that offers payment methods.
- **Use the Apple-provided API to display the button** — it's always correct and auto-localizes.
- **Custom buttons must not display "Apple Pay" or the Apple Pay logo.** Instead, show the Apple Pay mark or reference Apple Pay in text on that page.
- **Apple Pay buttons: use only to start payment or set-up.** Don't hide or gray the button — if pre-conditions aren't met, reveal the issue after the tap.
- **Apple Pay mark: use only to communicate acceptance**, not as a button.

## Streamlining Checkout

- Keep checkout cohesive; don't open new windows or send people to a separate checkout flow.
- **Present Apple Pay first** — preselect it or display it larger; visually separate it from other options.
- **Add Apple Pay buttons on product detail pages** for single-item quick purchase (exclude cart contents).
- **Express checkout** — immediately display the payment sheet for multi-item purchases.
- **Collect required info (size, color, etc.) before people reach the button.** Gracefully point to missing info after tap.
- **Collect optional info (gift messages, delivery instructions) before or after** checkout — not on the payment sheet.
- **Single shipping method per order.** For multi-destination orders, collect details before checkout begins.
- **In-store pickup**: select location before the payment sheet; display as read-only on the sheet.
- **Prefer info from Apple Pay** as more up-to-date over stored app data.
- **Avoid requiring account creation before purchase.** Offer sign-up on the order confirmation page; pre-fill from payment sheet data.
- **Always display an order confirmation** page after success.

### Payment Sheet Customization

- **Request only essential information.**
- **Display or allow entry of coupon/promo codes** on the sheet.
- **Line items** — explain additional charges, discounts, pending costs, subscriptions, donations. Not an itemized product list. Keep short; fit on one line.
- **Business name after "Pay"** — use the exact name on the bank statement. E.g., _Pay [Business_Name]_.
- **If you're a marketplace/intermediary** — name both businesses: _Pay [End_Merchant] (via [Your_Business])_.
- **Pending amounts** — clearly disclose; use Amount Pending.
- **Shipping methods** — show description, cost, and estimated delivery date; use shipping method's calendar/timezone support (iOS 15+).

### Error Handling

- Validate data at sheet-appear time and on field changes.
- **Error messages**: specific, field-referencing, ≤128 characters. Noun phrases, sentence-case, no punctuation. E.g., "Zip code doesn't match city."
- **Don't force compliance with business logic that can be inferred** — accept Zip+4 if you need 5-digit, accept multiple phone formats.
- **Handle interruptions (cancel, timeout) by cancelling in-progress payment.**

## Subscriptions and Donations

- For trials, use line items to show free trial period, discount duration, and first paid renewal. Avoid billing-agreement fields that contradict the sheet's line items.
- **Subscriptions**: clarify billing frequency before the payment sheet. Line items reiterating frequency, discounts, and upfront fees. Show payment amount clearly in the total.
- **Only show the payment sheet when a subscription change adds fees.**
- **Donations**: use a line item to label the donation (e.g., _Donation $50.00_). Offer predefined amount buttons + Other Amount.

- Don't translate "Apple Pay." Always English.
- Don't use the Apple logo to represent "Apple" in text.
- APPLE PAY (all caps) only when your UI capitalizes all text.

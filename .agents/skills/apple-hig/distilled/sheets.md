# Sheets

> A sheet helps people perform a scoped task closely related to their current context, without fully leaving that context.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

**Modal by default** (macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS always modal). iOS/iPadOS also support **nonmodal sheets** - the sheet stays open and directly affects the parent view without requiring dismissal (e.g., Notes formatting panel).

## Best Practices

Provide an alternative to Done when a more specific completion action is clearer. Pair Done with Cancel or Back so people can exit without confirming, and avoid showing Cancel, Done, and Back together.

- **Simple content or tasks only** - a sheet keeps some of the parent view visible, maintaining context. For complex or long flows use full-screen modal (iOS/iPadOS), a new window (macOS), or a Full Space transition (visionOS).
- **One sheet at a time** - if a task inside a sheet spawns another sheet, close the first before showing the second (restore it after the second dismisses if needed). Never stack sheets.
- **Nonmodal sheets for supplementary items that affect the main task** - for ongoing parallel access, consider a split view (visionOS) or panel (macOS).

## Platform Considerations

### iOS, iPadOS

**Detents** - the heights at which a resizable sheet naturally rests:

- `large` (full height) - supported by default.
- `medium` (~half height) - add to support progressive disclosure.
- Specifying only `medium` prevents full expansion.

**When to use medium detent:** when the most relevant content is immediately visible at half-height (e.g., share sheet) and people expand only to see more. Don't use medium if the sheet needs full height to be usable (Mail/Messages compose = full height only).

- **Include a grabber** in resizable sheets - visible affordance for dragging; also works with VoiceOver. Tapping the grabber cycles through detents.
- **Support swipe to dismiss** - if people have unsaved changes when swiping, show an action sheet to confirm before discarding.
- **Button placement:**
  - Single-view sheet: Cancel/Close on the leading edge; Done on the trailing edge.
  - Multi-step flow: first step has Cancel leading and Done trailing; subsequent/final steps replace Cancel with Back leading and keep Done trailing.
- **iPadOS: prefer page or form sheet presentation styles** - default size, centered with dimmed background.

### macOS

- Sheet is a card with rounded corners floating over a dimmed parent window.
- **Let people interact with other app windows without dismissing the sheet** - other windows can be brought forward even while the sheet is open.
- **Reasonable default size** - people don't expect to resize sheets, but support resize for sheets where expanded view is helpful.
- **Use a panel instead of a sheet** for repeated input-and-observe workflows (e.g., Find and Replace).

### visionOS

- Sheet floats in front of and dims the parent window.
- **Don't emerge from the bottom edge** - center the sheet in the field of view.
- **Default size that preserves context** - don't cover most or all of the parent window.

### watchOS

- Full-screen view that slides over the current content. Semi-transparent (blurred/desaturated background).
- **Only when a modal task requires a custom title or custom content.** For simple info or choices, use an alert or action sheet.
- **Brief and occasional** - temporary interruption only; not for app navigation.
- **If changing the label, use SF Symbols** - text in the top-leading corner that looks like a title confuses people about how to dismiss.

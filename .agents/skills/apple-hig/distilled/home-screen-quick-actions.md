# Home Screen Quick Actions

> Home Screen quick actions give people fast access to key tasks directly from the Home Screen icon — via touch-and-hold (or 3D Touch press).

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS _(not macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS)_

Each quick action includes a **title**, **interface icon** (left or right depending on icon position on screen), and an **optional subtitle**. Title and subtitle are always left-aligned in LTR languages. Maximum of **4 quick actions** per app.

## Best Practices

- **High-value, compelling tasks only** — e.g., Maps' "Directions Home." People expect at least one useful action from every app.
- **Dynamic actions are great; keep changes predictable.** Update based on location, recent activity, time of day, or settings changes — but don't surprise people.
- **Succinct title** — instantly communicates the result (e.g., "Directions Home," "New Message"). No app name, no extraneous info. Keep text short (localization aware, avoid truncation). Use subtitle for extra context only when needed.
- **SF Symbols for icons** — prefer standard SF Symbols. If you design a custom icon, use the Quick Action Icon Template in Apple Design Resources for iOS and iPadOS.
- **No emoji** — quick action icons are monochromatic and adapt to Dark Mode; emoji don't.

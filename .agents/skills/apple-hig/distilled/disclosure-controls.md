# Disclosure Controls

> Disclosure controls reveal and hide information or functionality associated with a specific control or view.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS _(not tvOS or watchOS)_

iOS/iPadOS/visionOS: via SwiftUI `DisclosureGroup`.

- **Show essential controls at top; hide advanced details by default** — keeps the interface from overwhelming users upfront.

## Disclosure Triangles

Show/hide information or a list associated with a _view or collection of items_ (e.g., Finder folder hierarchy, Keynote advanced export options).

- **Points inward (leading)** when hidden → **points down** when visible. Clicking/tapping toggles.
- **Descriptive label required** — label indicates what's inside: "Advanced Options."

## Disclosure Buttons

Show/hide functionality associated with a _specific control_ (e.g., macOS Save sheet: reveals full navigation panel when clicked).

- **Points down** when hidden → **points up** when visible. Clicking/tapping toggles.
- **Place near the content it controls** — users must clearly see the relationship between the button and the expanded content.
- **Max one per view** — multiple disclosure buttons add confusion.

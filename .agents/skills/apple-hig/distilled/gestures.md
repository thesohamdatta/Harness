# Gestures

> A gesture is a physical motion used to directly affect an object in an app, whether on a touchscreen, in the air, or via an input device.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

## Standard Gestures (All Platforms)

| Gesture              | Supported platforms                  | Common action                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Tap                  | All                                  | Activate a control; select an item             |
| Swipe                | All                                  | Reveal actions/controls; dismiss views; scroll |
| Drag                 | All                                  | Move a UI element                              |
| Touch/pinch and hold | iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS | Reveal additional controls or functionality    |
| Double tap           | All                                  | Zoom in/out; primary action on Apple Watch     |
| Zoom (pinch)         | iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS   | Zoom or magnify content                        |
| Rotate               | iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS   | Rotate selected item                           |

## Best Practices

- Support standard gestures everywhere they apply.
- **Multiple input methods** — don't assume people can perform a specific gesture. Support voice, keyboard, Switch Control alternatives.
- **Consistent with expectations** — tap activates/selects, swipe scrolls. Don't repurpose familiar gestures for unique app actions, and don't require unique gestures for standard actions.
- **Responsive** — provide immediate feedback. As people gesture, show what will happen.
- **Communicate unavailability** — if a gesture doesn't work, indicate clearly why (locked object indicator, visibly disabled button state), or people will assume the app froze.

## Custom Gestures

Add only for specialized tasks not covered by standard gestures (e.g., games, drawing apps). If you define a custom gesture, it must be:

- Discoverable
- Straightforward to perform
- Distinct from other gestures
- Not the only way to do an important action

- **Teach custom gestures** — in-app moments with simple language and graphics. If it's hard to explain, it'll be hard to learn.
- **Custom gestures supplement, never replace standard gestures** — always provide a standard fallback (e.g., a Back button alongside a swipe-from-edge shortcut).
- **Avoid conflicting with system gestures** — e.g., edge swipes in watchOS, hand-roll to access system overlays in visionOS.

## Platform Considerations

### iOS, iPadOS — Additional Expected Gestures

| Gesture                         | Common action       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Three-finger swipe left         | Initiate undo       |
| Three-finger swipe right        | Initiate redo       |
| Three-finger pinch in           | Copy selected text  |
| Three-finger pinch out          | Paste copied text   |
| Four-finger swipe (iPadOS only) | Switch between apps |
| Shake                           | Initiate undo/redo  |

- **Simultaneous gestures**: consider allowing in games (e.g., joystick + fire button at same time). See apple-pencil-and-scribble for Pencil + touch coordination.

### macOS

Primary: keyboard + mouse. Standard gestures also work on Magic Trackpad, Magic Mouse, and game controllers with touch surfaces.

### tvOS

Standard gestures via Siri Remote, compatible remotes, or game controllers with touch surfaces. See remotes.

### visionOS

Two gesture categories:

**Indirect** — look at an object to target it, then manipulate from a distance (e.g., tap finger to thumb to select). Comfortable at any distance; quick to redirect focus. Preferred for UI and common components.

**Direct** — physically touch the interactive object (e.g., type on the virtual keyboard). Best for infrequent use; arm fatigue can result. visionOS supports direct versions of all standard gestures.

**Direct gesture reference:**

Offer both indirect and direct interactions when possible, and avoid requiring specific body movements or positions.

| Direct gesture                    | Common use                      |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Touch                             | Select or activate              |
| Touch and hold                    | Open contextual menu            |
| Touch and drag                    | Move object                     |
| Double touch                      | Preview; select a word          |
| Swipe                             | Reveal actions; dismiss; scroll |
| Two-hand pinch together/apart     | Zoom in/out                     |
| Two-hand pinch in circular motion | Rotate                          |

Custom visionOS gestures:

- Requires Full Space + hand access permission.
- **Prioritize comfort** — avoid sustained raised arms; repetitive similar movements cause muscle fatigue.
- **Avoid hand-specific gestures** — don't require a specific hand; adds cognitive load and excludes users with limb differences.
- Careful with complex multi-finger/two-hand gestures — offer an alternative for single-hand users.
- **Reserve palm area for system overlays** — don't anchor content to hands/wrists. In Full Space, you may defer the Home indicator so the first tap reveals the indicator instead of exiting.
- **Avoid rolling-hand motions** — reserved for system overlays. In visionOS 2+, rolling the palm accesses Home and Control Center; in visionOS 1, an upward palm motion invokes the accessibility options menu. Legacy Full Space apps defer system gestures by default.

### watchOS — Double Tap (watchOS 11+)

Scrolls lists/scroll views; advances vertical tab views; activates a designated primary action in a view/widget/Live Activity.

- In notifications, Double Tap performs the first nondestructive notification action.
- **Don't set a primary action in views with lists, scroll views, or vertical tabs** — conflicts with default double-tap navigation.
- **Choose the most commonly used button as the primary action** — e.g., play/pause in a media controls view.

# Keyboards

> Physical keyboards are essential on Mac and commonly used on iPad; they enable text entry, app control, game play, and keyboard shortcuts.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS _(not watchOS)_

## Best Practices

- **Support Full Keyboard Access** (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, visionOS) — lets people navigate and activate all UI using only keyboard. Test by enabling it in Settings > Accessibility.
  - iPadOS: support keyboard navigation in text fields, text views, and sidebars. Do NOT support keyboard navigation for controls (buttons, segmented controls, switches) — use Full Keyboard Access for those.
- **Respect standard keyboard shortcuts** — don't repurpose them for custom actions. Only redefine if the action doesn't exist in your app (e.g., a non-text app can reuse ⌘I for Get Info).

## Standard Keyboard Shortcuts

**In general, don’t repurpose standard keyboard shortcuts for custom actions.** People can get confused when the shortcuts they know work differently in your app or game. Only consider redefining a standard shortcut if its action doesn’t make sense in your experience. For example, if your app doesn’t support text editing, it doesn’t need a text-styling command like Italic, so you might repurpose Command–I for an action that has more relevance, like Get Info.

People expect each of the following standard keyboard shortcuts to perform the action listed in the table below.

| Primary key       | Keyboard shortcut             | Action                                                                                                                                                                              |

The system also defines several keyboard shortcuts for use with localized versions of the system, localized keyboards, keyboard layouts, and input methods. These shortcuts don’t correspond directly to menu commands.

| Keyboard shortcut            | Action                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Control-Space                | Toggle between the current and last input source.          |
| Control-Option-Space         | Switch to the next input source in the list.               |
| [Modifier key]-Command-Space | Varies.                                                    |
| Command-Right arrow          | Change keyboard layout to current layout of Roman script.  |
| Command-Left arrow           | Change keyboard layout to current layout of system script. |

## Custom keyboard shortcuts

**Define custom keyboard shortcuts for only the most frequently used app-specific commands.** People appreciate using keyboard shortcuts for actions they perform frequently, but defining too many new shortcuts can make your app seem difficult to learn.

**Use modifier keys in ways that people expect.** For example, pressing Command while dragging moves items as a group, and pressing Shift while drag-resizing constrains resizing to the item’s aspect ratio. In addition, holding an arrow key moves the selected item by the smallest app-defined unit of distance until people release the key.

Here are the modifier keys and the symbols that represent them.

| Modifier key | Symbol                                                                                                                                         | Recommended usage                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command      | [Image: Outline of a stylized clover shape.]                                                                                                   | Prefer the Command key as the main modifier key in a custom keyboard shortcut.                                                                            |
| Shift        | [Image: Outline of an upward-pointing arrow.]                                                                                                  | Prefer the Shift key as a secondary modifier that complements a related shortcut.                                                                         |
| Option       | [Image: Line segments that suggest a horizontally transformed Z shape combined with a short horizontal segment aligned with the top of the Z.] | Use the Option modifier sparingly for less-common commands or power features.                                                                             |
| Control      | [Image: A shallow, upside-down V shape.]                                                                                                       | Avoid using the Control key as a modifier. The system uses Control in many systemwide features and shortcuts, like moving focus or capturing screenshots. |

> **tip:**
> Some languages require modifier keys to generate certain characters. For example, on a French keyboard, Option-5 generates the “{“ character. It’s usually safe to use the Command key as a modifier, but avoid using an additional modifier with characters that aren’t available on all keyboards. If you must use a modifier other than Command, prefer using it only with the alphabetic characters.

**List modifier keys in the correct order.** If you use more than one modifier key in a custom shortcut, always list them in this order: Control, Option, Shift, Command.

**Avoid adding Shift to a shortcut that uses the upper character of a two-character key.** People already understand that they must hold the Shift key to type the upper character of a two-character key, so it’s clearer to simply list the upper character in the shortcut. For example, the keyboard shortcut for Hide Status Bar is Command-Slash, whereas the keyboard shortcut for Help is Command-Question mark, not Shift-Command-Slash.

**Let the system localize and mirror your keyboard shortcuts as needed.** The system automatically localizes a shortcut’s primary and modifier keys to support the currently connected keyboard; if your app or game switches to a right-to-left layout, the system automatically mirrors the shortcut. For guidance, see [Right to left](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left).

**Avoid creating a new shortcut by adding a modifier to an existing shortcut for an unrelated command.** For example, because people are accustomed to using Command-Z for undoing an action, it would be confusing to use Shift-Command-Z as the shortcut for a command that’s unrelated to undo and redo.

## Platform Considerations

### visionOS

- Keyboard shortcuts appear in a shortcut interface (shown when holding ⌘ on a connected keyboard). Organized like menu bar menus (File, Edit, View, etc.) but flat — no submenus.
- **Write self-descriptive shortcut titles** — without submenu context, each title must convey its action standalone.
- **Connected physical keyboard shows a virtual overlay** — provides typing completion and other controls; the overlay is system-managed.

# ShazamKit

> ShazamKit matches audio samples against the ShazamKit catalog or a custom audio catalog for recognition features.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

**Use cases:** Recognize audio samples; sync graphics to music genre; provide captions or sign language synced to audio; synchronize in-app experiences with virtual content in online learning or retail.

**Requires microphone permission** if sampling live audio — always explain why you need access.

## Best Practices

- **Stop recording as soon as possible.** Users don't expect the microphone to stay on after the recognition sample is captured. Record only as long as needed.
- **Let people opt in to storing recognized songs to their iCloud library.** Don't store automatically — always get explicit approval first.

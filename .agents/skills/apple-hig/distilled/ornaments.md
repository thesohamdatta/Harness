# Ornaments

> In visionOS, an ornament presents controls and information related to a window without crowding or obscuring window contents.

**Platforms:** visionOS only

Ornaments float in a plane parallel to and slightly in front of the window (z-axis). They move with the window; they don't scroll with window content. System toolbars and tab bars in visionOS are automatically implemented as ornaments.

Ornaments can appear on any window edge and can contain buttons, segmented controls, and other views.

## Best Practices

- **Use for frequently needed controls that need a consistent, predictable location** — e.g., Music's Now Playing controls always in the same place.
- **Keep ornaments visible by default** — hiding during immersive content interaction (video, photos) is acceptable, but generally people appreciate consistent access.
- **Multiple ornaments: prioritize visual balance** — ornaments elevate important actions but can distract from content. Limit the total number; if needed, remove an ornament and move its elements into the main window.
- **Width ≤ window width** — wider ornaments interfere with a tab bar or other vertical content on the window's side.
- **Borderless buttons** — ornament background is glass; buttons on the glass surface typically don't need a border. System applies hover effect automatically when people look at a borderless button.
- **Use system toolbars/tab bars instead of custom ornaments for those functions** — they auto-appear as ornaments; no manual setup needed.

# Materials

> Materials create depth, layering, and hierarchy between foreground and background elements by allowing color to pass through.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

Apple provides two material types: **Liquid Glass** (controls/navigation layer) and **standard materials** (content layer differentiation).

## Liquid Glass

Liquid Glass forms the functional layer for controls and navigation (tab bars, sidebars). It floats above content, lets content scroll/peek through, and maintains control legibility.

- **Don't use Liquid Glass in the content layer.** It's for interactive elements only. Exception: transient interactive controls (sliders, toggles) briefly adopt Liquid Glass when activated.
- **Use sparingly on custom controls.** System components adopt it automatically. Overusing on custom controls distracts from content. Limit to most important functional elements.
- **Only use clear Liquid Glass over visually rich backgrounds** (photos, video). For text-heavy components (alerts, sidebars, popovers) use regular variant.
- Liquid Glass appearance can change with preferred Liquid Glass look, Reduce Transparency, and Increase Contrast.

**Two Liquid Glass variants:**

- **Regular** (`Glass.regular`) — blurs and adjusts luminosity of background; used by most system components. Scroll edge effects further preserve legibility by blurring and reducing opacity of background content. Use when background may cause legibility issues or component has significant text.
- **Clear** (`Glass.clear`) — highly translucent; prioritizes background content visibility. Use over media backgrounds for an immersive feel.

**Dimming layer behind clear Liquid Glass:**

- Bright underlying content: add dark dimming layer at 35% opacity.
- Sufficiently dark content, or AVKit standard playback controls (which provide their own dimmer): no dimming layer needed.

## Standard Materials

Use standard materials within the content layer for visual structure and separation. APIs: `UIBlurEffect`, `UIVibrancyEffect`, `NSVisualEffectView.BlendingMode`, `SwiftUI.Material`, `NSVisualEffectView.Material`.

- Choose based on semantic meaning and purpose, not the color the material imparts (system settings alter appearance).
- Use vibrant (system-defined) colors on top of materials for automatic adaptation to accessibility and appearance contexts.
- Thicker (more opaque) materials = better contrast for text/fine details. Thinner (more translucent) = better context retention from background.

## Platform Considerations

### iOS, iPadOS

Four standard materials available for the content layer: `ultraThin`, `thin`, `regular` (default), `thick`.

Vibrancy values for **labels** (use on any material; avoid quaternary on thin/ultraThin):

- `UIVibrancyEffectStyle.label`, `.secondaryLabel`, `.tertiaryLabel`, `.quaternaryLabel`

Vibrancy values for **fills** (all materials):

- `UIVibrancyEffectStyle.fill`, `.secondaryFill`, `.tertiaryFill`

One default vibrancy value for **separators** (`UIVibrancyEffectStyle.separator`, works on all materials).

### macOS

Provides several standard materials with designated purposes, and vibrant versions of all system colors.

- Choose when to allow vibrancy in custom views/controls — test in varied contexts.
- Choose a background blending mode: **behind window** or **within window**.

### tvOS

Liquid Glass appears in navigation elements, Top Shelf, and Control Center. Image views and buttons adopt Liquid Glass when focused.

Standard materials for content layer:

| Material    | Use for                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ultraThin` | Full-screen views requiring light color scheme                |
| `thin`      | Overlay views partially obscuring content; light color scheme |
| `regular`   | Overlay views partially obscuring content                     |
| `thick`     | Overlay views partially obscuring content; dark color scheme  |

### visionOS

Windows use **glass** — a system-defined adaptive material letting physical surroundings, environments, and virtual content show through. Glass limits background color range to maintain contrast while adapting luminance to surroundings. No separate Dark Mode — glass adapts automatically.

- Prefer translucency over opacity in windows. Opaque areas block surroundings and feel confining.
- When creating custom components, choose system materials by purpose:
  - `thin` — interactive elements (buttons, selected items)
  - `regular` — visual section separation (sidebar, grouped table)
  - `thick` — dark elements that must remain distinct over a `regular` background

Vibrancy values for visionOS foreground content:

- `label` — standard text
- `secondaryLabel` — footnotes, subtitles
- `tertiaryLabel` — inactive elements where high legibility isn't required

### watchOS

Use materials to provide context in full-screen modal views. Don't remove or replace system-provided material backgrounds in modal sheets.

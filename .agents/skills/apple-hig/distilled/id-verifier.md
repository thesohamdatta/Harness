# ID Verifier

> ID Verifier lets your iPhone app read ISO 18013-5 compliant mobile IDs in person, without external hardware. Available in iOS 17+.

**Platforms:** iOS only

## Request Types

| Type          | How it works                                                                                  | Transmits data to app?                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Display Only  | Shows name, age threshold result, or portrait in system-provided UI on the requester's iPhone | No — data stays within system UI      |
| Data Transfer | Transfers data (address, date of birth) to your app                                           | Yes — requires additional entitlement |

Use Data Transfer only if you have a legal verification requirement to store or process that data.

## Best Practices

- **Ask only for the data you need.** For age verification, use a age-threshold request — not birth date or current age.
- **Register with Apple Business Register if your app qualifies** to display your official organization name and logo to customers during the verification UI.
- **Provide a clearly labeled button** to initiate the verification process. Use "Verify Age" or "Verify Identity." Don't include NFC/QR symbols. Never include the Apple logo.

### Button Labels

| Button          | Use when                                                                         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verify Age      | Checking minimum age for an event or venue                                       |
| Verify Identity | Verifying specific identity info (e.g., name + birth date for car rental pickup) |

- **Display Only**: provide `Matches Person` / `Doesn't Match Person` buttons so your app can record the reviewer's visual confirmation result.

# The Menu Bar

> The macOS and iPadOS menu bar at the screen top displays top-level app menus. Mac users expect a consistent, discoverable menu structure — it's how they learn what an app can do.

**Platforms:** iPadOS, macOS _(not iOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS)_

## Menu Bar Anatomy (order matters)

1. _YourAppName_
2. File
3. Edit
4. Format
5. View
6. App-specific menus (custom, if any)
7. Window
8. Help

macOS also has the Apple menu (leading) and menu bar extras (trailing).

## Best Practices

- **Support all standard menus in standard order.** System often implements functionality for you (e.g., Edit > Copy for text selection).
- **Always show the same menu items** — disable, don't hide. Hidden items are invisible to people learning your app.
- **Use standard system icons** for common actions (Copy, Share, Delete, etc.) — see [icons.md](icons.md).
- **Support standard keyboard shortcuts** for all included menu items.
- **One-word menu titles preferred** — title-style caps if multi-word.

## App Menu

Items apply to the app as a whole, not to any specific document.

| Item                              | Action                                    | Notes                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| About _YourAppName_               | Opens About window                        | ≤16 char name, no version number             |
| Settings…                         | Opens settings                            | App-level only; doc settings go in File menu |
| _(Custom app-config items)_       | Custom actions                            | After Settings, in same group                |
| Services _(macOS only)_           | System/other-app services submenu         | —                                            |
| Hide _YourAppName_ _(macOS only)_ | Hides app + windows                       | Same short name as About                     |
| Hide Others _(macOS only)_        | Hides all other apps                      | —                                            |
| Show All _(macOS only)_           | Shows all other apps                      | —                                            |
| Quit _YourAppName_                | Quits app; Option → Quit and Keep Windows | Same short name as About                     |

**About** must be first, separated by a divider.

## File Menu

Manage files/documents. Rename or remove if app doesn't handle files.

| Item        | Notes                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New _Item_  | Name for the item type (e.g., Event, Calendar)                               |
| Open        | Ellipsis if opens picker                                                     |
| Open Recent | Recent files by last-opened order, most recent first; "Clear Menu" at bottom |
| Close       | Option → Close All; tab-based → Close Tab                                    |
| Close Tab   | Current tab in a tab-based window; Option → Close Other Tabs                 |
| Close File  | Current file and all associated windows                                      |
| Save        | Auto-save periodically; no need for constant manual saves                    |
| Save All    | Saves all open documents                                                     |
| Duplicate   | Prefer over Save As, Export, Copy To — more explicit about file relationship |
| Rename…     | —                                                                            |
| Move To…    | —                                                                            |
| Export As…  | For formats your app doesn't natively use; original stays open               |
| Revert To   | Version browser when autosave is on                                          |
| Page Setup… | Doc-specific print params                                                    |
| Print…      | Standard Print panel                                                         |

## Edit Menu

| Cut / Copy / Paste    | Standard clipboard ops                                                                               |

| Delete                | Not "Erase" or "Clear" — consistent with Delete key                                                  |
| Select All            | —                                                                                                    |

| Emoji & Symbols       | _(System adds automatically at bottom)_                                                              |

## Format Menu

Exclude if app doesn't support formatted text editing.

| Item | Submenu contents                                                                    |

| Font | Show Fonts, Bold, Italic, Underline, Bigger, Smaller, Show Colors, Copy/Paste Style |
| Text | Align Left/Center/Right/Justify, Writing Direction, Show Ruler, Copy/Paste Ruler    |

## View Menu

Customizes window appearance. Include even if only supporting full-screen.

- **Show/hide item titles must reflect current state** (if toolbar is hidden → "Show Toolbar"; if visible → "Hide Toolbar").
- Does NOT include window navigation/close commands (those are in Window menu).

| Item                              | Action                            |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Show/Hide Tab Bar                 | Toggle tab bar                    |
| Show All Tabs / Exit Tab Overview | Mission Control-like tab overview |
| Show/Hide Toolbar                 | Toggle toolbar                    |

| Enter/Exit Full Screen            | Full-screen mode                  |

## App-Specific Menus

Custom menus go between View and Window. Reflect app hierarchy (e.g., Mail: Mailbox → Message → Format). Order from most to least general.

**Always list commands here** — even if accessible elsewhere. Menu bar = discoverability + keyboard shortcuts + Full Keyboard Access.

## Window Menu

Navigation and management of windows. Provide even with just one window.

| Item                     | Notes                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Minimize                 | Option → Minimize All                                                          |
| Zoom                     | Toggle content-sized vs user-sized. Option → Zoom All. **Not for full-screen** |
| Show Previous / Next Tab | Tab-based navigation                                                           |
| Move Tab to New Window   | —                                                                              |
| Merge All Windows        | All in one tabbed window                                                       |
| Enter/Exit Full Screen   | Only if no View menu                                                           |
| Bring All to Front       | Option → Arrange in Front                                                      |
| _(Open windows list)_    | Alphabetical, windows only — no panels                                         |

## Help Menu

At trailing end of menu bar. macOS auto-adds search field when using Help Book format.

| Item                                 | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Send _YourAppName_ Feedback to Apple | Opens Feedback Assistant                      |
| _YourAppName_ Help                   | Opens Help Viewer (Help Book format)          |
| _(Additional items)_                 | Separate with divider; keep total count small |

## Dynamic Menu Items

Items that change behavior when a modifier key is held (e.g., Minimize → Minimize All with Option).

- Not the **only** way to accomplish the task — they're hidden by default.
- Best in menu bar menus only (not contextual or Dock menus).
- **Single modifier key only** — multi-key combos are awkward and undiscoverable.

## iPadOS vs macOS Differences

|                      | iPadOS                                                             | macOS             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Menu bar visibility  | Hidden until revealed (swipe from top or move pointer to top edge) | Always visible    |
| Horizontal alignment | Centered                                                           | Leading           |
| Menu bar extras      | Not available                                                      | Yes               |
| Window controls      | In menu bar when full screen                                       | Never in menu bar |
| Apple menu           | Not available                                                      | Always available  |
| App menu             | No About, Services, or visibility items                            | Full              |

**iPadOS-specific rules:**

- **All functions must also exist in your app's UI** — menu bar is hidden often.
- Settings menu item → iPadOS Settings page only. Internal preferences = separate item in the same group.
- Tab navigation: consider adding each tab as a View menu item with a key binding.
- Use submenus more liberally — iPad rows are taller, screen is smaller.

## macOS Menu Bar Extras

An icon in the trailing end of the menu bar that persists even when your app isn't frontmost.

- **Use a symbol** (SF Symbol or custom icon) — black + clear shapes, system handles dark/light.
- **Display a menu, not a popover**, when clicked. Exception: complex functionality.
- **Let people decide** whether to show your extra — don't add it automatically.
- **Don't rely on extras being visible** — system hides them when space is tight.
- **Provide alternate access** (e.g., Dock menu) since the extra can always be hidden.
- Menu bar height: **24 pt.**

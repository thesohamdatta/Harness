# Column Views

> A column view (also called a _browser_) lets people navigate a data hierarchy using a series of vertical columns, each representing one level.

**Platforms:** macOS only _(iPadOS/visionOS: use split-views instead)_

Each column shows a level of the hierarchy. Parent items with children are marked with a triangle. Selecting a parent fills the next column with its children. People navigate until reaching a childless item; can go back up to explore other branches.

## Best Practices

- **Best for deep hierarchies with frequent back-and-forth navigation** (vs. tasks where sorting in lists/tables is more important). Classic example: Finder's column view for directory structures.
- **Root of the data hierarchy in the first column** — people can always scroll left to start over.
- **Show info about the selected item when no children remain** — e.g., Finder shows a preview and metadata (created, modified, type, size).
- **Let people resize columns** — especially important when item names exceed the default column width.

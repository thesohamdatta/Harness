# iCloud

> iCloud gives people seamless access to their content across all devices, without explicit syncing. Your app should treat iCloud as transparent and always available.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

## Best Practices

- **Respect the system iCloud setting.** People turn on iCloud in Settings and expect apps to work automatically.
- **If you need a first-open choice, keep it simple.** Offer an all-data-or-none decision only when people may reasonably want control; don't ask which individual documents to keep in iCloud.
- **Keep content up to date.** Always provide the most recent version. For very large documents, indicate when a newer version is available in iCloud and provide subtle download progress feedback after a few seconds.
- **Respect iCloud storage.** Use it only for user-created content — not app resources or regenerable data. Avoid bloating the Documents folder (iCloud backs it up).
- **Handle iCloud unavailability gracefully.** No alert when someone manually disables it or uses Airplane Mode. Unobtrusively note that changes won't appear on other devices until iCloud is restored.
- **Sync app state, not just files.** Use iCloud to remember last-viewed position, preferences that apply across all devices (be selective — some settings are device-specific).
- **Warn before deleting.** iCloud deletion removes the document from all devices — always confirm.
- **Resolve conflicts promptly.** Auto-resolve when possible. If not, show an unobtrusive diff of conflicting versions; resolve early so no time is wasted in the wrong version.
- **Include iCloud content in search results.**
- **Games: save progress to iCloud.** Use the GameSave framework for sync, offline handling, and conflict alerts.

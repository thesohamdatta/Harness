# Generative AI

> Generative AI uses ML models to create and transform text, images, and other content. Use it where it provides clear value; design responsibly.

**Platforms:** iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, watchOS

## Core Principles

- **Responsible design**: AI outcomes vary with the same input; you can't predict all requests. Design for inclusion, privacy, and care.
- **Keep people in control**: let people dismiss, revert, retry, or adjust AI outputs. Always let them know when AI is being used.
- **Inclusive experiences**: AI models favor common training data; watch for biases. Ask people for info rather than inferring sensitive attributes. Test with diverse groups.
- **Offer generative features only where they add clear, specific value** (time savings, better communication, enhanced creativity).
- **Ensure a great experience even when AI is unavailable or declined.** Offer a non-AI fallback whenever possible.

## Transparency

- **Disclose AI use** - set expectations; never trick people into thinking they're interacting with human-authored content.
- **Clarify capabilities and limitations** - brief tutorial on introduction; example prompts for open-ended features. For limitations, see [machine-learning#Limitations].
- Align disclosure approach with local regulations.
- Review `Acceptable Use Requirements for the Foundation Models Framework` when using Apple Foundation Models.

## Privacy

- Choose a model type that fits the feature's needs and protects privacy; don't assume server, cloud, or on-device processing is automatically right.
- **On-device models** (for example, `Foundation Models`) can be faster, work offline, and avoid sending data off-device when they meet the use case.
- **Server-based models**: process as much as possible locally first; minimize what's shared. Tell people if info may be sent to a server; explain what's stored or used for training.
- **Ask permission before using personal information** (messages, photos, usage data). Use the minimum data needed; always offer opt-out.
- **Disclose clearly**: how data is used, stored, shared with third parties. Get explicit permission if storing for model improvement.
- Apps for kids have stricter requirements.

## Models and Datasets

- **Evaluate model capabilities hands-on early.** Know what it can and can't do. Some model types require a compatible device with Apple Intelligence on.
- Use Apple resource families like `Foundation Models` and `Core AI` when they fit the task.
- **Choose datasets intentionally**: diverse, representatively sourced, properly licensed. Test and mitigate bias proactively.

## Inputs

- **Guide people** toward producing great results - offer example prompts.
- **Address hallucinations proactively**: AI may produce plausible but false content. Communicate that outputs may contain errors. Don't use AI for facts unless the model has verified, up-to-date data. Never use AI output where hallucinations could cause harm.
- **Get confirmation before destructive or hard-to-undo actions** (deleting photos, making purchases). Avoid automating such actions.
- **Review model usage policies and regional AI regulations** before deployment.

## Outputs

- Surface controls such as **Edit**, **Undo**, **Retry**, and **Adjust** near generated output; acknowledge when corrections take effect.
- **Help people improve blocked/poor requests** - coach them; offer example prompts that would succeed.
- **Reduce harmful outcomes**: test for out-of-scope requests, poorly phrased inputs, sensitive topics, misuse scenarios. Use results to improve the model and policies.
- **Avoid replicating copyrighted content**: use models that guard against this; curate approved prompts; explicitly tell the model to avoid certain styles.
- **Factor in latency**: generative models take time. Prefer specific status messages over generic "Processing..." text. Generate in the background when possible and show progress/interim content when useful.
- **Plain-language failures**: explain what happened and the next step people can take.
- **Offer alternate result versions** when multiple meaningfully different outputs are possible; gives people control.

## Continuous Improvement

- **Plan for model iteration**: update to adapt to behavior, incorporate feedback, and leverage new capabilities. Some updates can happen frequently; major changes may align with app updates.
- **Let people voluntarily share feedback** on outputs - thumbs up/down for quick feedback, detailed report for complex issues. Take feedback seriously and resolve issues quickly. Feedback mechanism must not interrupt the experience.
- **Design adaptable features**: separate model from UX so you can swap models over time.
